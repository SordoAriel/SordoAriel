  Hi there! My name is Ariel Sordo, i´m from Argentina, and after studying and working as psychologist, i introduced myself into the IT world, making since february 2023 the Full Stack Developer career at CoderHouse

  I found very satisfying to code and to program. I´ve always loved logical problems, and, even when i took other ways, I always had a predilection and greater facility for logical-mathematical thinking.
  
  At this reposotory you can find -by now- my projects along the 4 different modules of the Full Stack Development course at CoderHouse:
    - Web development, where we aplied HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap & responsive design;
    - JavaScript, in which we begin to become familiar with the language;
    - ReactJS, finalizing the Front-End part, knowing and implementing the principles of this library;
    - Backend Development, where we used Node.JS and Express.JS as environment, and MongoDB as Data Base support
  
  If you are watching this profile, hope you interest in what you find, and i´ll be glad to hear your opinion about how to improve my work -learning never stops-.
Greetings!
